# Oscillon formation and decay in $\alpha$-attractor models
This repository contains codes and data related to the study of oscillon and nonlinear structure formation (and their decay) in $\alpha$-attractor models. A large portion of the data stored in this repository has been generated using the publicly available lattice simulation code CosmoLattice.
